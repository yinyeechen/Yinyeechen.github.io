        <h2 class="title">Aruba</h2>
        <p>The destination information about the three islands is copied from Lonely Planet. North Americans fleeing winter make Aruba the most touristed island in the southern Caribbean. The draws are obvious: miles of glorious white-sand beach, plenty of all-inclusive resorts, and a cute, compact capital, Oranjestad, which is well suited to the short strolls favored by cruise-ship passengers. It’s all about sun, fun and spending money.

Venture away from the resorts and you're in for a real treat. At the island’s extreme ends are rugged, windswept vistas and uncrowded beaches – perfect for hiking and horseback riding. Crystal-clear waters are bursting with sea life and shipwrecks (and an airplane wreck or two), providing incredible opportunities for snorkeling and diving. And nonstop breezes create near-perfect conditions for windsurfing and kiteboarding.

So whether you're longing to lounge on a beach or delve into the great outdoors, Aruba has you covered. One happy island, indeed! </p>
        <h2 class="title">Curacao</h2>
        <p>With its delightful Dutch colonial architecture, thriving art and culinary scenes and excellent history museums, go-go Curaçao feels like a little piece of Europe at the edge of the Caribbean. A little piece of Europe, that is, with glorious hidden beaches, wondrous caves, amazing snorkeling and diving, and a wild, undeveloped windward coast dotted with prickly cacti and whiptail blue lizards.

Curaçao also has a surging economy beyond tourism, which means that Willemstad has factories, humdrum neighborhoods and sometimes bad traffic. Catering to visitors is not the primary aim here, which lends the island more authenticity than its neighbors tend to offer. So if you’re looking for a Caribbean destination that's busy setting its own pace – a place where the adventuring tends to be a bit more unbridled – Curaçao is right for you.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Bonaire</h2>
       <p> A small island with a desert landscape, Bonaire is not for everyone – but it is for divers and snorkelers who want to immerse themselves in that vibrant world under the sea. The beauty of Bonaire is that the coral reef, designated a national park, is just a few feet from the shoreline. Dozens of exceptional dive sites are easily accessible from the shore and teeming with life, making this island an independent diver's (and snorkeler's) paradise.

Above the surface there's world-class windsurfing on Lac Bay and excellent kayaking among the mangroves. Biking trails wind through the arid hills, while driving routes show off the island's historical and natural sights. Classy but low-key resorts and a few enticing restaurants complete the picture – perfect for travelers who prefer their adventure with some amenities.</p>

        <h3 class="title">How to Get there</h3>
        <p> Unfortunately the options for getting there directly from Europe are few and far between. You can fly with KLM from Amsterdam or Condor from Frankrut (but only in the winter flight schedule. Alternatively there are thes options available to you 
        <li> Transit via USA</li>
        <li> Transit via Canada</li>
        <li> Transit via South America</li></p>
        
        <h3 class="title">Getting Around</h3>
        <p> Believe it or not but the only way to get between the islands once you are there is by <em>plane</em> or <em>private boat</em>. Although, there was in the past and there is talk of introducing them again, there are currently <strong>no</strong> ferry services between the islands. Factor these flights into your travel budget if your planning on island-hopping! Here are a list or airlines in the region
